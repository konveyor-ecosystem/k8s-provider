  message: |
    One or more containers in this deployment are missing a readiness probe. Without a readiness probe, the kubelet will
    assume the container is ready for traffic as soon as it starts.

  category: optional
  message: |
    One or more containers in this deployment are missing a liveness probe. Liveness probes allow the kubelet to identify
    when a running container is no longer responding correctly and needs to be restarted.

  message: |
    One or more containers in this deployment appear to have identical liveness and readiness probes. Reusing the same
    endpoint for both liveness and readiness probes diminishes their usefulness.
